# Dan Manners' Homelab

> <strong>Notice - </strong> This repository is on hold for a little while I'm working on non-tech related things. I'm planning on being back early 2023 in full swing, working on more Kubernetes and cloud things in the homelab! üôÇ

Current status: **BETA** (but is highly stable)

This project aims to utilize industry-standard tooling and practices in order to both perform it's functions and act as a repository for people to reference for their own learning and work.

## üîç Features

- [x] Easy to replicate GitOps
- [x] Modularity; make it easy to add/remove components
- [x] Hybrid Multi-Cloud
- [x] External DNS updates
- [x] Automagic cert management
- [x] In-Cluster Container Registry
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting üöß
- [ ] Automated Backups üöß
- [x] ~~Cluster SSO through GitHub~~ - Removed when switching from K3s to Talos

## Deployment Order of Operations

While this section is a Work-in-Progress, I'd like to provide some relevant information on core services that must be deployed and in which order.

1. [Talos Linux](talos/)
2. [Cilium CNI](manifests/bootstrapping/01-cilium/)
3. [MetalLB](manifests/bootstrapping/02-metallb/)
4. [Cert-Manager](manifests/bootstrapping/03-cert-manager/)
5. [External-DNS](manifests/bootstrapping/04-external-dns/)
6. [Traefik](manifests/bootstrapping/05-traefik/)
7. [ArgoCD - Part One](manifests/bootstrapping/06-argocd/)
8. [ArgoCD - Part Two](manifests/bootstrapping/07-bootstrapping-argoprojects/)

## Identifying Problems, Troubleshooting Steps, and more

Below are a few things that may be beneficial to you when troubleshooting or getting things up and operational

### Traffic is not getting from the edge (cloud) nodes to the on-prem cluster networking

You can validate that your remote traffic is or isn't making it on site by using `dig` inside of the [netshoot container]()

```bash
kubectl run temp-troubleshooting \
  --rm -it -n default \
  --overrides='{"apiVersion":"v1","spec":{"nodeSelector":{"kubernetes.io/hostname":"talos-aws-grav01"}}}' \
  --pod-running-timeout 3m \
  --image=docker.io/nicolaka/netshoot:latest \
  --command -- /bin/bash
```

Then, you can validate that you can reach CoreDNS or another pod/service IP from your remote node.

If you can prove it is not working, you may want to restart all of Cilium:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart -n kube-system daemonset cilium
```

## To-Do Items

- Ensure that **ALL** services are tagged for the appropriate hardware (`arm64` or `amd64`) to ensure runtime success
  - Alternatively, ensure that all containers are built for multi-architecture.
- Ensure that **ALL** application and service subdirectories have READMEs explaining what they're doing and what someone else may need to modify for their own environment

## Gratitude and Thanks

This README redesign was inspired by several other homelab repos, individuals, and communities.

Without the inspiration and help of these individuals and communities, I don't think my own project would be nearly as far. Make sure to check out their projects as well!
